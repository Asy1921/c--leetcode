## Installation

Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed. Open this repo on vs code and let VS Code automatically generate launch and task json file. Then you can run it by pressing F5.

## Usage

You can call the fns in Program.cs. I've also added a stopwatch using Systems.Reflections and all the solutions are in a partial class called LCProblems. Make an object of that class to call the functions.
