In case the .vscode files are not automatically generate, pres Ctrl+Shift+P and run .NET Generate Assets for Build and Debug

You can call the fns in Program.cs. I've also added a stopwatch using Systems.Reflections to check the run time. All the solutions are in a partial class called LCProblems. Make an object of that class to call the functions.
